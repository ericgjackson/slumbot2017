t1 betting abstraction has ~300,000 betting sequences.  Many bet sizes
on preflop and flop.  About eight.  Bet and raise on turn and river.
9118 hands with four bets on flop out of 5.6m that make it to the
flop.  59,375 hands with three bets on flop.  That's a bit over 1%.

Preflop 11,122 out of 11m hands with four bets.  That's 1/1000.
Preflop 73,182 out of 11m hands with three bets.  That's a bit less than 1%.

It seems like current plan of supporting four bets on preflop and flop
is a good one.  Will very rarely need to resolve on either preflop or
flop.  Could easily allow a minute or two to resolve on those streets.

I wonder though if we should allow a richer betting abstraction on the
turn or river.  Can I test this on a small game?  I guess I should trade
betting granularity for card granularity?

Suppose I want to solve something on my machine with 300,000 betting
sequences.  Maybe I'll use targeted CFR with one byte per river bucket.
1000 buckets would be 300m infosets and 300 megabytes. 10k buckets
would be 3g.  Maybe 50k buckets?

With base, I am trading off abstraction size in early streets vs. abstraction
size in later streets.

I guess I need to evaluate with expand_strategy.

Seems like I need a bet as small as 1/16 pot.  If I try to expand 1/8
to 1/16 I lose 100 mbb/g.  See testi/testj in expansion_results.

Even with 0.03 and 0.06 if I try to expand from 0.06 to 0.03 then I lose
20 mbb/g.

Seems like I need a huge number of bets.  Or I can build a system with
lots of missing bets and dynamically solve whenever opponent makes a small
bet.

We only need a large number of bets when the pot gets large.  Can I
get by with a moderate number in smaller pots?

11m hands.
497,138 have a bet to 10,000 or more.
  10,000 is 100 big blinds.
  That's around 5%.
171,006 have a bet to 10,000 or more and a call
  That's around 1.5%.
An additional 101,411 have  abet to 5,000 or more and a call
Total: 272417
  That's around 2.5%.

Have tree construction method.  Up to pot size X adds equally
spaced bets.  Start with minbet and with all-in bet and compute pot
fractions.  Suppose we double pot frac.  Suppose pot size is 10 BB.
All-in is 190BB which is 19x.  Min bet is 1/10.  So 1/10, 1/5, 2/5, 4/5, 8/5,
~3x, ~6x, ~12x, all-in.  9 bet sizes.
Suppose pot size is 20 BB.  Min bet is 1/20.  So 1 BB, 2 BB, 4 BB, 8 BB,
16 BB, 32 BB, 64 BB, 128 BB, all-in.  9 bet sizes.
Suppose pot size is 40 BB.  So 1 BB, 2 BB, 4 BB, 8 BB, 16 BB, 32 BB, 64 BB,
128 BB, all-in.  9 bet sizes.
Larger pots don't have more bet sizes.

Use doubling approach starting from min bet for opponent.  Allow 1/2 pot
and full pot for us with a maximum of four bets.
ms0: 1699 betting sequences in each of P1 and P2 tree
ms1: 82811 betting sequences in each of P1 and P2 tree
82,811 betting sequences times 1.7m hands is 140 billion information sets.
A lot.  With 8 bytes per info set that would be a bit over a terabyte.
Would also need a bit of room for the turn and river.

So I need to make cuts.  This will mean I will need to resolve on the flop
sometimes.  That's OK, I was already anticipating that.  Shouldn't be that
often, I hope.  More than half of the betting sequences have six or
more bets.  That's got to be pretty uncommon in practice.

ms1f1/none/n2a requires 10.2g.

How big would a betting tree be that is mb4b7aa on preflop and flop,
but mb3b1 after that?
734,226 betting sequences
  2,935 preflop
  69,514 flop
  175,042 turn
  486,735 river
1,286,792 null flop buckets
1286792 * 69514 = 89,450,059,088 flop information sets (~90b)
If I can encode regrets with one byte and maintain only the current
strategy, that's 90 gigs.

Hang on, I should use asymmetric betting abstraction.  So there would
be many fewer betting sequences.

big1asym p0 or p1:
  268,615 betting sequences
  22,616 flop betting sequences
  29,102,087,872 flop information sets
  183,516 river betting sequences

Maybe I can reduce betting tree after N bets on preflop and flop.

Out of 22,616 flop betting sequences in big1asym/p0:
22,614 have at least one bet
22,574 have at least two bets
22,270 have at least three bets
20,750 have at least four bets
15,302 have at least five bets

1,246,451 betting sequences (for both P0 and P1 trees)

1m river buckets, one byte per bucket, would mean 1 TB
29 gigabytes for perfect flop with one byte per bucket
116 gigabytes for perfect flop with four bytes per bucket
233 gigabytes for perfect flop with eight bytes per bucket
466 gigabytes for perfect flop with sixteen bytes per bucket

Suppose I want to use 1m turn buckets and two doubles for turn regrets
and sumprobs.  That's 1.5 TB.  Maybe doable actually.  But I can
shrink if I don't need to save turn strategy in big pots.
340 GB for flop assuming perfect abstraction and doubles for regret and
sumprob.
79,612 turn nodes have pot size of 100 or more.
58,988 turn nodes have pot size of 200 or more.
0.2 * 800 is 160.

Should allow more bets for opponent on turn, but only when pot is small.

  69,064 have pot sizes >= 300
  90,306 have pot sizes >= 200
1,262,340 river betting sequences

With 16 bytes per river bucket could perhaps have 50,000 river buckets
50,000 * 16 * 1,262,340 = 1 terabyte
With 1 byte per river bucket could perhaps have 800,000 river buckets
With 16 bytes per turn bucket could perhaps have 500,000 turn buckets
  500,000 * 16 * 123286 = 1 terabyte
  500,000 turn buckets is about a 100:1 reduction
Null flop will take 200 GB: 
  1286792 * 9730 * 16 = 200,327,778,560

-----------------------------

Used asymmetric experiments to determine what bets I need for target
player.  I gave the opponent a wide variety of bet sizes (roughly eight).
I gave the target player two or three bet sizes.  I ran run_rgbr on the
resulting system.  The closer the exploitability is to zero, the better
the set of target player bet sizes.

How do I determine the best set of bet sizes for the opponent?

One approach is to:
1) Build a system with a small candidate set of bet sizes
2) Measure exploitability
3) Expand to a larger set of bet sizes
4) Measure exploitability

If the exploitability gap between (2) and (4) is small, then the small
candidate set of bet sizes may be sufficient.
